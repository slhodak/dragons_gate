combat
  attack type


playing notes:
  turn √
  status (immobilized, etc) √
  stronger soldiers as they die √
  flag-bearer influence √
  shuriken distance damage √
  random unit select for ryu (bad idea? branch?)
  font size picker
  gate objective -- not just brawl (pretty fun as brawl)
  hex board
  UI simplify √


Refactor:
  Status effects into hash that is copied to unit
    including turns damned, poison damage, rolls for effects

Bug:
  Units are loaded as PO objects, not instances of respective classes
    Load classes from object data when loading game from file

Notes from Play-Through:
  It was fun!
  DO NOT CHANGE STATS!
    if you do, keep a copy of the old ones
  automatic next turn when no moves left
  shinja revive
  damned didn't remove attack button
  poisoned death didn't remove attack button
  deceased/HP 0 have defense buttons
  skip faction if all units deceassed (what about shinja?)
  is immobilized working? (I think so...)
