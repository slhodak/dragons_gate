units need to track attacks left
  for special attacks and -1 means immobilized
  units gain one attack left per turn until reaching a maximum
game needs to track turns
  whose turn it is
  events occur at the end of a turn, such as attacksLeft++
make lore available in a different page/menu clickable

combat
  attack type


playing notes:
  turn √
  status (immobilized, etc) √
  stronger soldiers as they die √
  flag-bearer influence √
  shuriken distance damage √
  random unit select for ryu (bad idea? branch?)
  font size picker
  gate objective -- not just brawl (pretty fun as brawl)
  hex board
  UI simplify √


Refactor:
  Status effects into hash that is copied to unit (less customizable. Maybe class?)
    including turns damned, poison damage, rolls for effects
  Attacks belong in an object? Premature optimization while there are only 2 kinds.
    They do belong in an object to check ranges readably (done)

Bug:
  Units are loaded as PO objects, not instances of respective classes
    Load classes from object data when loading game from file

Notes from Play-Through:
  It was fun!
  DO NOT CHANGE STATS!
    if you do, keep a copy of the old ones
  automatic next turn when no moves left
  shinja revive
  damned didn't remove attack button √
  poisoned death didn't remove attack button √
  deceased/HP 0 have defense buttons √
  skip faction if all units deceassed (what about shinja?)
  is immobilized working? (I think so...)


Square Board

  only contains id of each unit in a square--not a reference
  save position data on unit?
     checking unit position with board much faster than scanning units--only practical way
     but doing movement you have to know "my distance"--this is okay, unit is loaded by id when calculated
  do not store location info on Unit

Next is to determine attack ranges
  hide/show defense buttons based on this

Must kill my darling.
  The unit stat area should not double as a combat area
  Also the fading loss display should be on the unit's board cell (low prio)
  gut it...


Render JSON as collapsible in Explorer (low prio)
  https://github.com/caldwell/renderjson

Use frontend env var to toggle presence of board square coordinates in view
  This is fine as always visible on hover
  (or for anything else)

DefenseButtons filter by Range 
Next turn resets/cancels all motion or attack in progress


Bugs from Playthrough #3:

empire unit die() calling forEach on faction string

marker for status on board

saving game means fix bug and keep playing

movement should cancel attack / vise versa (done)

can attack deceased players? or only because die() not called?

errors not displaying in fetch catches from non-success statuses
