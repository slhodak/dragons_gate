playing notes:

  status (immobilized, etc) √
  load game not working √
  stronger soldiers as they die
  flag-bearer influence
  shuriken distance damage
  random unit select for ryu
  font size picker
  gate objective -- not just brawl
  hex board

Refactor:
  Status effects into something that is stored on unit
    in unit's status with object cloning from status enum?
    including turns damned, poison damage, rolls for effects

Bug:
  Units are loaded as PO objects, not instances of respective classes
  Must load classes with object data when loading game from file
