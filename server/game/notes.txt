units need to track attacks left
  for special attacks and -1 means immobilized
  units gain one attack left per turn until reaching a maximum
game needs to track turns
  whose turn it is
  events occur at the end of a turn, such as attacksLeft++
make lore available in a different page/menu clickable

combat
  attack type


playing notes:
  turn √
  status (immobilized, etc) √
  stronger soldiers as they die √
  flag-bearer influence √
  shuriken distance damage √
  random unit select for ryu (bad idea? branch?)
  font size picker
  gate objective -- not just brawl (pretty fun as brawl)
  hex board
  UI simplify √


Refactor:
  Status effects into hash that is copied to unit (less customizable. Maybe class?)
    including turns damned, poison damage, rolls for effects
  Attacks belong in an object? Premature optimization while there are only 2 kinds.
    They do belong in an object to check ranges readably (done)

Bug:
  Units are loaded as PO objects, not instances of respective classes
    Load classes from object data when loading game from file

Notes from Play-Through:
  It was fun!
  DO NOT CHANGE STATS!
    if you do, keep a copy of the old ones
  automatic next turn when no moves left
  shinja revive
  damned didn't remove attack button √
  poisoned death didn't remove attack button √
  deceased/HP 0 have defense buttons √
  skip faction if all units deceassed (what about shinja?)
  is immobilized working? (I think so...)


Square Board

  only contains id of each unit in a square--not a reference
  save position data on unit?
     checking unit position with board much faster than scanning units--only practical way
     but doing movement you have to know "my distance"--this is okay, unit is loaded by id when calculated
  do not store location info on Unit

Next is to determine attack ranges
  hide/show defense buttons based on this

Must kill my darling.
  The unit stat area should not double as a combat area
  Also the fading loss display should be on the unit's board cell (low prio)
  gut it...


Render JSON as collapsible in Explorer (low prio)
  https://github.com/caldwell/renderjson

Use frontend env var to toggle presence of board square coordinates in view
  This is fine as always visible on hover
  (or for anything else)

DefenseButtons filter by Range 
Next turn resets/cancels all motion or attack in progress


Bugs from Playthrough #3:
  empire unit die() calling forEach on faction string √
  marker for status on board √
  saving game means fix bug and keep playing √
  movement should cancel attack / vise versa √
  errors not displaying in fetch catches from non-success statuses √
  can attack deceased players? or only because die() not called?
  units are affected even after death?
  yuma can move after attacking? canceling move/attack matters?
  yuma can move after death
  immobilized not blocking buttons
  can still move after death by damnation
  attack range not visible to players
  attack button not clickable when no enemies in range?
  or hovering on button shows range?
    ... think about it


Play through with Travis Notes:
  implement Shinja

  ended turn when yuma had movement left
  move after damned death?
  yuma move  after death?
  nerf damned?
  include the rolls — little delay?
    show loss
  block unit paths past enemies

  load game 
  multi-client


PM2 - Process Management
  Starting Websocket server in terminal shows first WSS only
    Hides other server logs, regardless of starting app in bg
  How do I log all of the WSS connections?
  How do I start all of them with PM2 or as subprocesses of node?
  How do I aggregate my logs from these processes?

WebSocket

Deal with closed or broken connections


Jason Playthrough Notes

  write special abilities on units or faction cards
  don't transmit players thinking about moves
  better show attack range
    only show attack button if units in range
    or highlight targets in red

  nerf kusarigama range (2)
  attack pathfinding/blocking
  shuriken losing movement after spending all ranged attacks
  opponents buttons shouldn't be visible to all players
    choose teams
  Show damage/rolls
  once you attack, cannot move (feature?)
  remove deceased from tiles?
    after a turn or two
  BUG: Can move deceased!?
    mover not selected though
    but move does go through, does propagate to all players
    FIX: death must reduce steps to zero

  FlagBearer range too low?
  Reset game button
  load (and maybe save?) broken in server/online version

ended turn when yuma had movement left

move after damned death?
yuma move  after death?
nerf damned?
include the rolls — little delay?

New Game button √

Board Coordinates issue
  0,0 at top left instead of bottom left
  flip horizontal
  - backward map / count down in react render?
  - 

love no border cell - but needs to work for ux
