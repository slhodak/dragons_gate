# Summary
- The Dragon's Gate is a portal to a spiritual realm where deep wisdom and artifacts promising power and prestige await adventurers who can defeat its fearsome Guardians.  
The Emperor has sent an army of 100,000 to peirce the veil and recover the mysterious treasures beyond the Gate. However, the journey was beset by supernatural interventions--storms, droughts, disease, and attack by wild animals were unleashed upon the Emperor's forces by Heaven to dissuade and prevent their ambitious march. A year later, 7 soldiers remain. Today they took the steps that have finally brought the Gate within sight, and are determined to prove to their leader--and to Heaven itself--that they are worthy of their goal.  
A year earlier, when the campaign was being planned, a soldier named Yuma sought the Emperor's blessing to command a unit of 40 soldiers, as she had distinguished herself in nearly two decades of military service. As she was denied, the Emperor added insult to injury when he suggested that, "You are a fine warrior, perhaps your sons will make great Officers. This is what your Empire asks of you." She felt the pangs of this dishonor, but her heart sunk deeper still under the weight of the injustice, for justice's sake. She told the Emperor that she would die before he would possess the treasures beyond the Gate, and through her declaration, was forced to fight her way out of the capital to safety. In the months following, she was joined by a few others who had risen high in the Emperor's service, only to be shot out of the sky in similarly unjust fashions. These powerful enemies of the Empire were outlaws, who will prevent the Emperor from passing the Gate, or pass through it themselves to share its benefits with the downtrodden people of the Empire.
The Gate is guarded by a Ryu, a 10,000-year-old dragon that can emit deadly beams of light from it's horns, as well as a Yokai, a supernatural goblin-like creature whose greatest joy is to thwart egotistic human ambitions. Finally, a Shinja, or devotee of the Gate, stands guard as well. This devotee was once the greatest warrior in his kingdom, and with his head full of haughty presumption, he abandoned his wife and two children in order to pursue the famous treasure beyond the Gate. As he was about to be killed by the Ryu, he said, "I am glad to have traded my life for this chance." "Your reasoning," the Ryu said, "Is flawed. You have taken joy in this journey, but have not traded merely your own life for this quest. You have traded the happiness of your family as well. This death, therefore, will not suffice as payment for your malfeasance. You must pay 3 additional lives as well." To this day, the devotee of the Gate must stay and guard it with all his strength, and die 3 more times before he will be permitted to rest in peace. Should he surrender to any challenger, he will not die by their blows. Because of his great skill, he has only died an honest death once in the previous four centuries, and eagerly awaits the time when worthy opponents will take his remaining 2 lives.

## Play Cycle

The game requires 3 players. Each possible combination of players controlling each faction is played. Therefore there are 6 rounds, as follows, where [1, 2, 3] represents each player, and [E,P,G] represents each faction.
1E 2P 3G
1E 2G 3P
1P 2E 3G
1P 2G 3E
1G 2E 3P
1G 2P 3E
The winner of the game is determined by the combined score of all rounds for each player.

Maximum possible score as each faction:
- Empire: 8
- Protectors: 8
- Guardians: 10
Maximum possible score for a player across all rounds: 8x4 + 10x2 = 52

## Faction Details
Base stats common to all pieces are Health Points (H: x), Movement Speed (S: cm), Attack Strength (A: xdy), Range (R: x), Armor Defense (A: xdy), and Health Regen (HR: x).

Elite Soldier
  - { H: 30, R: 2, S: 3, A: 2d4, D: 2d4, HR: 2 }
  - A is 3d4 while Flag-Bearer is alive.

  - Yuma can move again after attacking.
Kusarigama (sickle, weight, and chain)
  - { H: 50, R: 3, S: 3, A: xdy, D: xdy, HR: 4 }
  - When K. attacks, first roll to immobilize the enemy. If the roll is > 7/10, double the result of the damage roll that follows. The unit that was immobilized will not be able to move next turn (but will be able to attack).
Daisho (two swords)
  - { H: 50, R: 2, S: 3, A: 3d4, D: 5dy4, HR: 4 }

  - S. can aim at anyone up to 10cm away, but the number of die rolled for Attack Damage is reduced by 1 for every 2cm away the enemy is.

### Guardians
- These spirits consist of 1 Ryu (dragon), 1 Yokai (demon-like creature) and 1 human Shinja (devotee) of the Gate.
Ryu
  - { H: 100, R: [50, 3], S: 0, A: [10d10, 4d4], D: 10d5, HR: 0 }
  - Ryu has two attacks, a ranged attack and a melee attack. The stats for these correspond to the 1st and second stats (ranged and melee), respectively, for R and A.
  - Ranged attack: Each piece on the board not belonging to the Guardians must be numbered from 1-n. Each turn, generate a random number in this range, and the unit for this number will be the target of Ryu's ranged attack. The number generator can produce a 0, in which case no unit was targeted by Ryu's ranged attack this turn.
Yokai
  - { H: 70, R: 3, S: 5, A: 1d10, D: 3d4, HR: 0 }
  - Y. can move twice or attack twice.
